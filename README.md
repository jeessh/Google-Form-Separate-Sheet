# This script is used to retrieve data entered into a google form and is pushed towards a separate spreadsheet.

Each data point that is used is numbered (ex: 1., 3A., etc.) depending on its respective appearance on the spreadsheet. The separation between path A and path B is dependent on the respondent's choice from a **multiple choice question** and the data pushed is changed because of it.
